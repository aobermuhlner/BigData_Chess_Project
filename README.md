# Chess Opening Analyzer

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze chess games with a focus on identifying players’ strengths and weaknesses in opening sequences. The application leverages data from the online chess platform Lichess.org and the chess engine Stockfish for position validation. It uses several optimizations, including multithreading, logistic regression, and parallel processing, to efficiently analyze games. The end goal is to help players deepen their understanding of their opening repertoire and provide better alternative variations for weakly executed openings.

## Features
- **Multithreaded Game Download**: Optimized downloading of games using multithreading, significantly reducing the time required to fetch game data.
- **Logistic Regression for Transition Detection**: Identifies the transition from the opening to the middlegame, allowing for focused analysis on the most relevant parts of the game.
- **Evaluation Caching**: Utilizes a dictionary of common chess positions to avoid redundant evaluations, enhancing efficiency.
- **Parallel Processing for Position Evaluation**: Distributes tasks across multiple processors to leverage computational power and reduce overall processing time.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Displays detailed insights into a player’s performance in different openings, highlighting strengths and weaknesses and suggesting improvements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Stockfish chess engine

### Installing Dependencies
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-opening-analyzer.git
   cd chess-opening-analyzer
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setting Up Stockfish
You need to install Stockfish manually. Download it from the [official Stockfish website](https://stockfishchess.org/download/). After downloading, extract the executable and note its path.

In your scripts, you will need to set the path to the Stockfish executable:
```python
stockfish_path = "path/to/your/stockfish_executable"
```

You can also define the strength and depth of Stockfish’s calculations by setting the `skill_level` and `depth` parameters:
```python
skill_level = 15  # Example: from 0 (beginner) to 20 (maximum strength)
depth = 15  # Depth of search for Stockfish
```

## Usage

### Loading Game Data
You can load the game data from a CSV file. The CSV file should have columns for moves and headers:
```python
games = load_game_data("file_name")
```

### Analyzing Games
To analyze the games, you can use the `get_analyzed_games` function:
```python
analyzed_games = get_analyzed_games(games)
```

### Saving Results
Results can be saved to a JSON file:
```python
save_results_to_json(analyzed_games, "output_file_path.json")
```

### Plotting Transition Distribution
To visualize the distribution of transition moves from opening to middlegame:
```python
plot_transition_distribution(analyzed_games)
```

## Examples

### Running the Analysis
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_name = "path/to/processed_games.csv"
    games = load_game_data(file_name)
    analyzed_games = get_analyzed_games(games)
    output_file_path = "path/to/analyzed_positions.json"
    save_results_to_json(analyzed_games, output_file_path)
    plot_transition_distribution(analyzed_games)
```

### Flask Endpoint for Downloading Games
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/download_games', methods=['GET'])
def download_games():
    return download_games()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
